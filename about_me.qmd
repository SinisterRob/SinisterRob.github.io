I'm Robert, an actuarial consultant living in Chicago.
I like photography, eating and reviewing good food, travelling, biking, chess, video games, predictive modelling, data visualization, watching Texas Longhorns football, and chilling with my cats.
I'm planning on using this blog to write about those things and more, so stay tuned!
