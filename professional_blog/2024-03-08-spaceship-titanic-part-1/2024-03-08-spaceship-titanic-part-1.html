<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post is going to be an explanation on how to use Stan to write a simple Bayesian (probabilistic) model.</p>
<p>The analysis is broken into parts to be more digestible and beginner-friendly, so that I am able to document the entire model building process from start to finish including data exploration, writing Stan code, and model validation.</p>
<p>I will be working with the data from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic">Spaceship Titanic</a> competition, which is a beginner friendly spin-off of the original Titanic dataset where the goal is to predict who on the Titanic lived and died after it crashed. In this challenge, I will be walking through the steps to create a Bayesian model that predicts whether passengers are transported to an alternate dimension or not.</p>

<section id="load-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="load-the-data">Load the Data</h2>
<p>The first steps in any data analysis done in R will be loading the libraries you want to use and reading in the data to a data.frame or a data.table object. I load the rstan packages because I will be writing the main part of the model in Stan, and set the options to use all of the cores on my computer and not recompile the model every time I run it (Stan models have to be compiled and simulated and that is a slow process.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-exploration-modeling-approach">Data Exploration &amp; Modeling Approach</h2>
<p>After looking at the predictive fields available in this data set, the first thing I do is try to come up a plan to approach the modeling structure.</p>
<p>I have a couple of initial thoughts here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We are trying to predict the Transported field which is a boolean variable: either TRUE or FALSE.</p></li>
<li><p>This leads me to believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> is probably the best and simplest modelling approach.</p></li>
<li><p>In statistical terms, this means we want a model with the following structure: <span class="math display">\[
\log\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right) = \alpha + \beta X
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This transformation (often called the logit function or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit">log-odds</a>) is useful, because it is a function that maps values between 0 and 1, like probabilities, to real numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="exploring-vip-age-and-homeplanet-variables" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploring-vip-age-and-homeplanet-variables">Exploring VIP, Age, and HomePlanet variables</h3>
<p>I want to start with a simple model, so I’ll start by examining the relationship between the <code>VIP</code>, <code>Age</code>, and <code>HomePlanet</code> explanatory variables and the <code>Transported</code> response variable.</p>
<p>This type of visual exploratory analysis is useful to see which of our data variables might provide some information that explains a difference in who was transported and who was not transported.</p>

<li><p>It appears there are three possible Home Planets: Earth, Europa, and Mars.</p></li>
<li><p>They all have different Transportation proportions which makes it a great candidate for a predictive variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The aliens really seem to have taken a liking to residents from Europa. I wonder if this is because they’re from Europa or if it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding">confounding</a> effect from some other variable in the dataset.</p></li>

<h1>Part 2: Building the Model</h1>
<p>That’s enough data exploration content for one blog post. Keep these relationships that I just discovered in mind, since they will be used to describe a probabilistic model on the odds of survival. In Part 2 of this series, I will be fitting a basic Bayesian model using these three predictive variables, and from that model establishing some fit statistics that will allow me to explore the model and refine it further.</p>
